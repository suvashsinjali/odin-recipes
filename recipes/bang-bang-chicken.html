            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1/3 cup milk</li>
                <li>1 large egg</li>
                <li>1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
                <li>1/4 cup potato starch</li>
                <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon shichimi togarashi (Japanese red pepper condiment)</li>
                <li>2 cups oil for frying, or as needed</li>
                <li>1/4 cup mayonnaise</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons honey</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons sweet chili sauce</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon gochujang (Korean hot pepper paste)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Whisk together milk and egg in a large bowl until well combined. Add chicken; stir to coat and allow to marinate for 15 minutes. Drain and discard egg mixture.</li>
                <li>Combine potato starch, flour, salt, pepper, and shichimi in a medium bowl. Pour into a large plastic resealable bag. Add chicken; seal the bag and shake until chicken is well coated.</li>
                <li>Heat 2 inches oil in a deep saucepan over medium heat to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Working in batches of about 5 to 8 pieces at a time, cook chicken in hot oil for about 90 seconds. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate; keep each batch separate.</li>
                <li>Increase oil temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). The oil should be continuously boiling at this point. Carefully re-add the first batch of chicken and fry for another 90 seconds.</li>
                <li>Remove to another paper towel-lined plate. Repeat with remaining batches of chicken.</li>
                <li>Mix together mayonnaise, honey, sweet chili sauce, and gochujang in a large serving bowl until combined.</li>
                <li>Toss fried chicken with sauce to coat. Serve and enjoy!</li>
