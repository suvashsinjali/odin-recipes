# odin-recipes
Hello everyone, my name is Suvash Sinjali from Nepal. I'm learning full-stack development with The Odin Project. This is the one of the best learning platform for free. 
Currently I'm learning the foundation course and in the verge of finishing HTML basics, today I'm going to work on a project named 'odin-recipes'.
Let's do this.
